Plant Disease detection
INTRODUCTION:

In agriculture, plant health is crucial for a good harvest. Diseases can harm plants and reduce food production. The system can rapidly and accurately identify plant diseases, allowing farmers to intervene promptly. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are algorithms that recognize image patterns, making them ideal for plant disease detection.
PROBLEM STATEMENT

Traditional disease detection methods are often time-consuming and rely heavily on human expertise. The Plant Disease Detection system enables farmers to swiftly and precisely identify plant diseases. This system allows them to take targeted actions to prevent losses.
